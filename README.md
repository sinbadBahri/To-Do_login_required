# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This is a To-Do list web application created by Django and HTML.

One should signup/signin first to acccess his or her own specific tasks; 

Create a new task and cross it when is done :)

I used django class-based views for this app.

Requirements
------------

-  [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-  [Django 2.7+](https://pypi.org/project/Django/)

## How to run

Create and activate your virtual environment :

    $ virtualenv -p python3 venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate

Then install the requirements :

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you're good to go ðŸ¤©
